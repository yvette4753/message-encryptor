# Caesar Cipher Encryption Tool
This is a beginner friendly Python program that encrypts and decrypts text using the Caesar Cipher. The user enters a message and a shift key, and the program returns an encrypted version of the message and then decrypts it back to the original message.

## Features
Encrypt any text using a shift key
Decrypt the encrypted text back to the original
Works with uppercase and lowercase letters
Helps beginners understand basic cryptography concepts

## How to Run
Make sure Python is installed
Run the script in your terminal:
python3 encrypt_tool.py
Enter a message when prompted
Enter a shift key (example: 3)

## Example
Enter message: hello world
Enter key: 3
Encrypted: khoor zruog
Decrypted: hello world

## What is the Caesar Cipher?
The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter in a message by a set number of places in the alphabet.

Example:
Shift key: 3
A → D
B → E
C → F

## Why I Built This
This project helped me learn how encryption works at a basic level, including ASCII values, character shifting, and user input handling in Python.
